SBA 4 Reflection

In this SBA the biggest obstacle that I had to overcome was figuring out how to incorporate localStorage because this was not only my first time
using it but my first time hearing about it when I first looked at the MDN documentation on it I was very confused which lead me to trying to find
multiple resources explaining how to correctly use localStorage. With this new knowledge of localStorage I do now feel like I could do the assignment
drastically faster because sixty percent of my time during this SBA was reading documentation and if I had more time to work on this SBA I would style
it in a much better way and maybe add some animations using javascript and have some better alerts.
